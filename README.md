## ✨ Overview & Introduction

Welcome to the **GDSC-FSC Weekly Technical Challenges 2024-2025** repository! This project serves as a structured learning platform for students and enthusiasts to understand the fundamental mechanics behind complex software systems. Inspired by platforms like CodeCrafters.io, this repository guides you through building simplified versions of real-world applications and protocols from the ground up.

**What is this application?**
This repository is a curated collection of independent coding challenges, each focused on recreating a core component of a widely used system. From crafting your own Kafka broker to implementing a DNS server, a shell, or even Git, each "week" presents a new challenge designed to deepen your understanding of computer science fundamentals and system design.

**Purpose & Goals:**
-   **Hands-on Learning:** Provide practical experience in system-level programming.
-   **Conceptual Mastery:** Demystify how foundational software like databases, networking protocols, and version control systems work.
-   **Skill Development:** Enhance problem-solving, debugging, and coding skills in various programming languages.
-   **Community Engagement:** Foster collaborative learning and knowledge sharing within the GDSC-FSC community.

**Why it matters / Problem it solves:**
Many developers use high-level abstractions without truly understanding the underlying mechanisms. This repository tackles that gap by offering challenges that force you to confront and solve the low-level problems that these systems address. This deep understanding is invaluable for writing more efficient code, debugging complex issues, and designing robust systems.

**Target Audience:**
-   Members of GDSC-FSC (Google Developer Student Clubs - Florida Southwestern State College).
-   Computer Science students looking for hands-on experience.
-   Aspiring software engineers preparing for technical interviews.
-   Anyone curious about the internals of popular software systems.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a monorepo, where each "week" constitutes an independent project or challenge. While each challenge has its own internal architecture (specific to the system being built), the overall repository structure is designed for modularity and easy navigation.

The core idea is:
`gdsc-fsc-gdg-fsc-weekly-technical-24-25/`
├── `week-X-byo-system-name/` (e.g., `week-1-byo-kafka/`)
│   ├── `README.md` (Challenge-specific instructions)
│   ├── `codecrafters.yml` (Configuration for CodeCrafters platform)
│   ├── `your_program.sh` (Local execution script)
│   ├── `app/` or `src/` (Your solution code)
│   └── ... (Language-specific files like `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, etc.)

### Initial Repository Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/gdg-fsc-weekly-technical-24-25.git
    cd gdg-fsc-weekly-technical-24-25
    ```

2.  **Generate Challenge Directories (Optional for Contributors):**
    The `setup.sh` script is primarily for maintainers to create the initial empty challenge directories. If you just cloned, these directories should already exist.
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    This script will create directories like `week-1-byo-kafka`, `week-2-byo-dns-server`, etc.

## 💡 Usage & Challenge Workflows

The primary usage of this repository is to engage with and complete the coding challenges. This involves understanding the problem, implementing a solution, testing it locally, and then pushing it for automated validation (often via CodeCrafters.io).

### General Challenge Flow

1.  **Select a Challenge:** Choose a `week-X-byo-challenge` that interests you.
2.  **Read the Challenge `README.md`:** Each challenge directory has its own `README.md` which contains specific instructions, requirements, and background information. This is your primary guide.
3.  **Set Up Environment:** Ensure you have the correct language runtime and dependencies installed for that specific challenge (refer to [Installation for a Specific Challenge](#installation-for-a-specific-challenge)).
4.  **Implement Your Solution:**
    *   Locate the main entry point file (e.g., `app/main.js`, `src/main.rs`, `src/main/java/com/dnsserver/Main.java`).
    *   Start by uncommenting or adding code for the first stage, as per the challenge's `README.md`.
    *   Iteratively build out the functionality, tackling one stage at a time.
5.  **Test Locally:** Use the provided `./your_program.sh` (or similar) script to run your solution and test it against local test cases or manual inputs.
    ```bash
    # Example: Run your Kafka program
    cd week-1-byo-kafka
    ./your_program.sh
    ```
6.  **Commit & Push:** Once your local tests pass, commit your changes. If you are participating via CodeCrafters.io, pushing to `master` (or your configured branch) will trigger automated tests.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Completed Stage 1 of BYO Kafka"
    git push origin master
    ```
7.  **Review Feedback:** Check the output from the automated tests. If there are failures, debug your code, make adjustments, and repeat steps 5-7.

[⬆️ Back to Top](#top)

### Example: Tackling the "Build Your Own Kafka" Challenge

Let's walk through a typical interaction with the `week-1-byo-kafka` challenge.

1.  **Navigate to the Challenge:**
    ```bash
    cd gdsc-fsc-weekly-technical-24-25/week-1-byo-kafka
    ```

2.  **Read Challenge Instructions:**
    Open `README.md` inside `week-1-byo-kafka`. It will guide you on setting up Node.js, the purpose of the challenge (implementing Kafka's APIVersions & Fetch API), and how to pass the first stage.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This downloads any required Node.js packages, as defined in `package.json`.

4.  **Implement Stage 1:**
    Open `app/main.js`. The `README.md` usually instructs you to uncomment a specific line or add minimal code to handle the initial connection or a simple request.
    ```javascript
    // app/main.js
    import net from "net";

    const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
      socket.on("data", (data) => {
        // Example: Just acknowledge receipt for stage 1
        console.log("Received data:", data.toString());
        // For actual Kafka, you'd parse the request and send a specific response.
        // For stage 1, this might be a simple "OK" or a fixed response.
        socket.write("PONG\r\n"); // Placeholder, actual response would be Kafka protocol
      });
      socket.on("close", () => {
        console.log("Client disconnected.");
      });
      socket.on("error", (err) => {
        console.error("Socket error:", err);
      });
    });

    server.listen(9092, "localhost", () => {
      console.log("Server listening on port 9092");
    });
    ```

5.  **Run Locally:**
    ```bash
    ./your_program.sh
    ```
    You'll see output like `Server listening on port 9092`.
    Now, from *another terminal*, you can test it:
    ```bash
    # Try connecting with netcat (or telnet)
    nc localhost 9092
    # Type something and press Enter (e.g., "Hello Kafka!")
    # You should see "PONG" if your server sends it.
    ```

6.  **Commit and Push:**
    If local testing looks good, commit your changes.
    ```bash
    git add week-1-byo-kafka/app/main.js
    git commit -m "feat(kafka): Pass Stage 1 - Basic server setup"
    git push origin master
    ```
    CodeCrafters.io will then run its automated tests against your pushed solution and provide feedback. You will then iterate, implementing Stage 2, and so on, until the challenge is complete.

## ⚠️ Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

This section outlines the current state, known quirks, and future direction of the GDSC-FSC Weekly Technical Challenges repository.

### Current Limitations

*   **Educational Scope:** The challenges aim to teach core concepts, not to build production-ready, highly optimized, or fully compliant systems. Implementations are often simplified.
*   **Platform Dependency:** The challenges are designed with CodeCrafters.io in mind for automated testing and progression. While solutions can be run locally, the full validation experience is on that platform.
*   **Language Specificity:** Each challenge typically focuses on one primary programming language, limiting exposure to multi-language implementations within a single challenge.
*   **Resource Intensiveness:** Some challenges (e.g., BitTorrent, Kafka) might require significant system resources or network bandwidth for local testing beyond basic functionality.

[⬆️ Back to Top](#top)

### Known Issues

*   **Setup Script Limitations:** The `setup.sh` script currently only creates empty directories. It does not populate them with initial template files for CodeCrafters.io (e.g., `codecrafters.yml`, starter code). These need to be manually added by a contributor or fetched from CodeCrafters.io.
*   **Version Skew:** Specific language or toolchain versions might evolve, potentially leading to compatibility issues if not updated in the `README.md` files or `codecrafters.yml`. Please report if you encounter such issues.
*   **Incomplete Local Test Suites:** While `./your_program.sh` allows local execution, a comprehensive local test suite mirroring CodeCrafters.io's environment might not always be available, making local debugging challenging before pushing.

[⬆️ Back to Top](#top)

### Future Roadmap & Planned Enhancements

We are continuously working to improve this repository and the learning experience it offers. Here are some planned enhancements:

*   **Expand Challenge Library:** Introduce new "Build Your Own" challenges covering areas like databases (SQL parser, B-tree), compilers, distributed systems, and more.
*   **Enhanced Local Testing:** Provide more robust local testing frameworks or scripts within each challenge to better mirror the CodeCrafters.io environment, reducing iteration time.
*   **Starter Templates:** Develop scaffolding tools or templates for new challenges to streamline contributor setup.
*   **Advanced Stages:** Potentially add "advanced" stages to existing challenges for those who want to dive even deeper (e.g., adding replication to Kafka, more complex Git commands).
*   **Community Showcase:** A dedicated section or external platform to showcase successful implementations and solutions from the GDSC-FSC community.
*   **Accessibility Improvements:** Ensure all `README.md` files are clear, concise, and easy to follow for all skill levels.

[⬆️ Back to Top](#top)

### Setting up a New Challenge

If you're contributing a new "Build Your Own" challenge:

1.  **Create a New Directory:** Name it `week-X-byo-system-name` (e.g., `week-11-byo-blockchain`). Use `count.py` to identify the next available week number if needed.
2.  **Add a Challenge `README.md`:** This is crucial. It should explain the challenge, its stages, and instructions for implementation.
3.  **Include `codecrafters.yml`:** This file defines the language pack and debug settings for CodeCrafters.io.
4.  **Provide `your_program.sh`:** The executable script that CodeCrafters.io (and local users) will use to run your solution.
5.  **Add Initial Code:** Provide a barebones `app/main.ext` or `src/main.ext` file with basic setup, often with commented-out sections for stages.
6.  **Include Language-Specific Config:** `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `Pipfile`, etc., along with their respective `.lock` files.
7.  **Update Main `README.md`:** Add your new challenge to the [Feature Highlights](#-feature-highlights) and, if applicable, to the [Architecture Diagram](#️-architecture--repository-structure) or [Changelog](#changelog).

### Branching and Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Main Branch:** The `main` branch is considered stable and contains the latest released version of the challenges.
*   **Feature Branches:** All new development, including new challenges or significant enhancements, should be done in feature branches (e.g., `feature/new-challenge-name`).
*   **Bugfix Branches:** For bug fixes, use bugfix branches (e.g., `bugfix/fix-dns-bug`).
*   **Pull Request Titles:** Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat(kafka): Implement stage 2 of APIVersions`, `docs: Update getting started guide`).
*   **Pull Request Description:** Clearly explain what your PR does, why it's needed, and any specific areas for review. Link to relevant issues.

### Code Style & Linting

While each language ecosystem has its own style conventions, we encourage:
*   **Readability:** Clear, well-commented code.
*   **Consistency:** Adhere to the style already present in the specific challenge's language.
*   **Automated Formatting:** Use tools like Prettier (JS/TS), Black (Python), `cargo fmt` (Rust), `go fmt` (Go) where applicable.

### Testing

*   **Local Testing:** Always use the `your_program.sh` script within the challenge directory to verify your solution locally before pushing.
*   **CodeCrafters.io:** The ultimate test for each challenge. Pushing to your configured branch will trigger their automated tests. Ensure your solution passes all stages.

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>❓ **Q: Do I have to use CodeCrafters.io to participate?**</summary>
<br>
**A:** While the challenges are inspired by and designed to be compatible with CodeCrafters.io's automated testing, you can certainly attempt and complete them by running your solutions locally. However, the full progression and automated feedback experience is best achieved through the platform.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ **Q: Can I use a different programming language for a challenge?**</summary>
<br>
**A:** Each challenge typically has a designated primary language (`app/main.js`, `src/main.rs`, etc.). While you are free to explore solutions in other languages in your *personal fork*, the official challenge submissions (especially for CodeCrafters.io) will expect the specified language. For new challenges, feel free to propose a language.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ **Q: I'm stuck on a stage. Where can I get help?**</summary>
<br>
**A:**
1.  **Re-read the `README.md`:** Ensure you haven't missed any subtle instructions or hints.
2.  **Review CodeCrafters.io Logs:** The error messages from the automated tests are often very helpful.
3.  **Debug Locally:** Use print statements, a debugger, or specific test cases to narrow down the issue.
4.  **Community Support:** Ask for help in the GDSC-FSC Discord channel or during technical sessions.
5.  **GitHub Issues:** If you suspect an issue with the challenge description or tests, open a GitHub issue.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ **Q: How are the "week" numbers determined?**</summary>
<br>
**A:** The `week-X` prefix simply indicates the sequential order in which challenges are introduced or tackled by the GDSC-FSC community. It helps organize the repository but doesn't necessarily mean you have to complete them in that exact order.
</details>

### Troubleshooting

*   **"Permission denied" when running `./your_program.sh`**:
    *   Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x your_program.sh`
*   **Language-specific errors (e.g., `command not found`, `module not found`)**:
    *   Verify that the correct language runtime and its package manager are installed and added to your system's PATH.
    *   Double-check the project's dependency installation steps (`npm install`, `cargo build`, `mvn install`, etc.).
*   **Network-related issues (e.g., `Address already in use`)**:
    *   Ensure no other program is running on the same port your challenge application is trying to bind to. You might need to kill the conflicting process or change the port.
*   **CodeCrafters.io tests fail but local tests pass**:
    *   The local test might be insufficient, or there's a subtle difference in the CodeCrafters.io environment. Review their detailed logs carefully.
    *   Ensure all necessary files are committed and pushed. Sometimes local changes aren't tracked.
